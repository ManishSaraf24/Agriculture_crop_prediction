# Agriculture Crop Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields in agriculture using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various environmental factors and historical crop data, the model predicts the potential yield for different crops, aiding farmers in decision-making processes.

## Features
- Predicts crop yields based on environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil quality, etc.
- Supports multiple crop types for prediction.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and make predictions.
- Provides insights into optimal conditions for different crops.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and visualization)

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing historical agricultural data including environmental factors and crop yields. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agriculture-crop-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the necessary dataset in the correct format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `crop_prediction.ipynb` to train the model and make predictions.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and parameters to improve prediction accuracy if needed.

## Results
- The trained model achieves an average accuracy of 99.9% on the test dataset.
- Sample predictions and visualizations are provided in the notebook for reference.
